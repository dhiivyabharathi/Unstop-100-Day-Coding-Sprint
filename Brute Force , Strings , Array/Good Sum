### **Mary and Flowers**

Given an array of size N. Suppose that at any index ‘i’, the array element is ‘X’. If X is negative, you have to remove the minimum elements present just before X such that the sum of those element is greater than or equal to absolute value of X. If the sum of those elements is less than abs(X), remove all elements before X.
After removing those elements, convert X to its absolute value and go to the next index and perform the same operation. 
Return the sum of all elements present in the array after performing the above operation.  

Note:
You must operate only if ‘X’ is negative.
For each new index, consider the modified array for operation.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer N.
The second line contains N elements - the array elements.

Output Format
The output should return the final sum after performing the mentioned operation.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^5. 
-10^4<=A[i]<=10^4 for all (0<=i<N)

4 2 2 3 -6 
Testcase Output
10
Explanation
Given array is 4,2,2,3,-6 
First, we push ‘a’ to stack.
Here, indices 0,1,2 and 3 are positive, so there is no need to operate.
Now at index 4, -6 is there. So x=-6.
We delete elements until the sum is less than abs(x), i.e., 6.
The minimum elements whose sum will be greater than or equal to abs(x) are 3(index=3), 2(index =2), and 2(index=1). So delete these three elements and convert x to its absolute value. 
Now the array will be {4,6}.
Hence the final answer will be 4+6=10.
 So, the result is 10.

# Answer: 
public class Main {
    public static int goodSum(int N, int[] A) {
        Deque<Integer> stack=new ArrayDeque<>();
        int sum=0;

        for(int a:A){
            if(a>=0){
                stack.push(a);
                sum+=a;
            }
            else{
                int required=-a;
                int removedsum=0;

                while(!stack.isEmpty() && removedsum<required){
                    int removedele=stack.pop();
                    removedsum+=removedele;
                    sum-=removedele;
                }
                stack.push(-a);
                sum+=-a;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();  // First input is the integer N
        int[] A = new int[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            A[i] = sc.nextInt();  // Remaining input is the array of integers
        }
        
        // Call user logic function and print the output
        int result = goodSum(N, A);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
